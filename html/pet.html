    <h1>Pet Policies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Each unit is allowed a maximum of 2 pets, which may include cats, dogs, or other domesticated animals typically kept as pets. Exotic or large animals may be restricted.</li>
        <li>All pets must be registered with the condominium association. Registration requires up-to-date proof of vaccinations, spaying/neutering (if required), and any necessary local pet licenses.</li>
        <li>Pets must be on a leash or carried when in common areas such as hallways, elevators, stairwells, and lobbies. Pets must always be under the control of their owner to avoid disturbance or danger to other residents.</li>
        <li>Pet owners are responsible for ensuring their pets do not create excessive noise, such as barking, whining, or howling, that could disturb neighbors. Persistent noise complaints may lead to fines or other actions.</li>
        <li>Pet owners are required to clean up after their pets immediately. Pet waste must be disposed of in designated waste areas or bins. Failure to comply with this rule may result in fines or other penalties.</li>
        <li>Pets that display aggressive behavior toward residents, other pets, or visitors may be required to be removed from the condominium if the behavior poses a risk. The condominium board will review any complaints and take appropriate actions after investigation.</li>
        <li>Certain large dog breeds or specific breeds considered aggressive may be restricted. Check the condominium’s list of restricted breeds before acquiring a pet.</li>
        <li>All pets must be regularly vaccinated and treated for fleas and ticks. Pets with any contagious health conditions should not be brought into common areas until treated.</li>
        <li>Pets are not allowed to be left unsupervised on balconies or near open windows, especially if they could pose a safety risk or become a nuisance to neighbors.</li>
        <li>Owners are not permitted to modify their units or common areas to accommodate pets (such as installing pet doors) without approval from the condominium association.</li>
        <li>Any pet-related issues or violations of the policy should be reported to the condominium association. Violations may result in warnings, fines, or in severe cases, the removal of the pet from the premises.</li>
        <li>In shared amenities like gardens, rooftop spaces, or courtyards, pet owners must ensure their pets do not disturb others. Some areas may have designated pet zones or may restrict pet access entirely.</li>
    </ul>
